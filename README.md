#PlexPy

NB: This project is still very early in development.

This project is based on code from Headphones (https://github.com/rembo10/headphones) and PlexWatchWeb (https://github.com/ecleese/plexWatchWeb).

A python based web application for monitoring and logging activity on your Plex Media Server.
